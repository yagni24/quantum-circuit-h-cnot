# quantum-circuit-h-cnot
This notebook demonstrates how to create a Bell state (entangled quantum state) using Qiskit. It applies Hadamard and CNOT gates on 2 qubits, simulates execution on qasm_simulator, and visualizes the measurement outcomes. Concepts: quantum superposition, entanglement, and measurement collapse.
